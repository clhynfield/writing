## Treat configuration as code



## Code – test and implementation – is essential

> Maintain only the code and the tests as permanent artifacts. Generate other documents from the code and tests. Rely on social mechanisms to keep alive important history of the project.

> Customers pay for the what the system does today and what the team can make the system do tomorrow. Any artifacts contributing to these two sources of value are themselves valuable. Everything else is waste.

## Use whiteboards for design

> Whiteboard diagrams are disposable, and that’s a good thing. Your drawings only represent your current understanding of the architecture, and the architecture **will** change.
