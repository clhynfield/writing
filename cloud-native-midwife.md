Platform engineering, as distinct from “infrastructure and operations”, is still a nascent field. Many people who build platforms for applications and services still think of themselves as “server admins” or “IT operations”. Some of the more progressive use terms like “infrastructure developers” or “infrastructure engineers”. 

What makes a good platform engineer, with respect to traditional IT ops roles? Infrastructure operators need to pick up skills traditionally found in app software engineering – infrastructure as clean, versioned code; testing and refactoring; continuous integration; pair programming. App developers – even “full-stack” – pick up new challenges in lower layers of the compute and especially network stacks. 

What makes a good platform product manager? First thought is often synonymous with project manager, but the two are almost at right angles, and a strong background in project management can hinder lean, experiment-based product thinking. 

So, what’s all this have to do with midwifery? 

As the natural father of nine, I have a _lot_ of experience with childbirth. My wife and I have had the pleasure of birthing under the care of midwives with eight of those children, and for the birth of one, _I_ was the midwife. 

Language, spoken and written: _Be delivered of_ the child, versus _birthing_ the child. Midwives Care cared for the _whole person_, and trusted the mother to own her own birth. At Midwives Care, Kris did her own measuring and tracking, and charts contained notes about how she was feeling, what she was afraid of and hopeful for, etc. Her chart had a lot of her own handwriting on it. Belief that she could do it herself. At the surgeon’s, surgeon’s tech did all measuring and tracking, and chart contained sterile notes about conditions, procedures, and results.
