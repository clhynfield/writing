  What’s this cloud-native midwifery business, anyway? IT industry is laboring to produce a new thing – the cloud-native platform product team. I’m here to help. I explain what to expect in a platform product team, and to ease your transition into a new role in cloud-native software delivery.

You can do this.

Shift in the industry from IT as cost center to software engineering as profit center and business differentiator. Platform product team is a response to that shift. 

Platform engineering, as distinct from “infrastructure and operations”, is still a nascent field. Many people who build platforms for applications and services still think of themselves as “server admins” or “IT operations”. Some of the more progressive use terms like “infrastructure developers” or “infrastructure engineers”. 

What makes a good platform engineer, with respect to traditional IT ops roles? Infrastructure operators need to pick up skills traditionally found in app software engineering – infrastructure as clean, versioned code; testing and refactoring; continuous integration; pair programming. App developers – even “full-stack” – pick up new challenges in lower layers of the compute and especially network stacks. Giving application product teams the self-service ability to deploy and manage apps on the platform can feel like a huge loss of control and even job security. 

What makes a good platform product manager? First thought is often synonymous with project manager, but the two are complementary at best, and people with a strong background in project management often find lean, experiment-based product thinking challenges their most basic beliefs about delivering value. 

So, what’s all this have to do with midwifery? 

As the natural father of nine, I have a _lot_ of experience with childbirth. My wife and I have had the pleasure of birthing under the care of midwives with eight of those children, and for the birth of one, _I_ was the midwife. The midwives my wife and I have worked with have respected that labor and delivery is the mother's work. The midwife is there largely to listen, to suggest techniques, and to support the mother in her work to deliver the child. Surgeons, on the other hand, often take a more direct approach, treating the mother as project to complete rather than as autonomous agent. 

As a consultant, I help ease people into their new roles. Much of my job is finding and redirecting the curiosity of the tinkerer, the efficiency of the automator, the meticulousness of the planner. The nerd in me also gets to learn and teach the principles and practices of disciplines like Site Reliability Engineering, Extreme Programming, and Lean Startup Product Management. 

You can do this. I believe in you.
