  What’s this cloud-native midwifery business, anyway?

As the natural father of nine, chances are, I have a _lot_ more experience with childbirth than you do. My wife and I have had the pleasure of birthing under the care of midwives with eight of those children; and for the birth of one, _I_ was the midwife. 

Language, spoken and written: _Be delivered of_ the child, versus _birthing_ the child. Midwives Care cared for the _whole person_, and trusted the mother to own her own birth. At Midwives Care, Kris did her own measuring and tracking, and charts contained notes about how she was feeling, what she was afraid of and hopeful for, etc. Her chart had a lot of her own handwriting on it. Belief that she could do it herself. At the surgeon’s, surgeon’s tech did all measuring and tracking, and chart contained sterile notes about conditions, procedures, and results.

Platform engineering is still a nascent field. Many people who build platforms for applications and services don’t really even yet identify as platform engineers.
