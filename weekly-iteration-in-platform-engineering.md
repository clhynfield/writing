If you’ve been an infrastructure or platform engineer for a while, you’re probably well acquainted with long project cycles. According to traditional customs, it takes several weeks of planning and preparatory meetings just to assemble and ready the project team. Then follow weeks of requirements-gathering and analysis, weeks of architecture and design, months of construction, weeks of early testing, and weeks of “operationalization” and documentation. Then, at release, you find that you’ve sunk the better part of a year building a platform that has missed the mark. If you’re lucky, you are only in for another several weeks of rework.

## How to make it real

- [Do the simplest thing that could possibly work][sttcpw]
- Release embarrassingly early, go for [_shoddiest_ viable product][svp]
- Decompose
