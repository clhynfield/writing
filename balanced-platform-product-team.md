# Everything necessary to succeed

> Include on the team people with all the skills and perspectives necessary for the project to succeed. This is really nothing more than the old idea of cross-functional teams. The name reflects the purpose of the practice, a sense of wholeness on the team, the ready availability of all the resources necessary to succeed. Where intense interactions [with people outside the team] are necessary for the health of the project, those interacting should be primarily identified with the team and not their functions.

## Reliability Engineering

## Product Thinking

## Design Thinking

## Secure Engineering

## Other skills as needed

> What constitutes a "whole team" is dynamic. If a set of skills or attitudes becomes important, bring a person with these skills on the team. If someone is no longer necessary, [she] can go elsewhere.

## Transforming hero culture

Oftentimes, teams form a culture around heroes. Imbalanced, rely on long hours and heroic efforts. Other contributors somtimes feel they can't measure up, or even ask questions for fear of looking ignorant. 

If there's a hero on the team, embrace them. Thank them for their immense knowledge, wisdom, and work, which truly have been keeping the team going up to this point in no small part. When they share a little bit of information, ask for more. Engineers love to show what they know. When they tell you how it works, ask why. Capture the why, as these are the team's requirements. This becomes a reverse-engineering conversation.
